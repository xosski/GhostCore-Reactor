## üß¨ WraithSkin Cloaking System ‚Äì Subsystem Flow Breakdown

### üî∞ System Activation
- Triggered via GhostResidency cloak manager
- Commanded by GhostCore AI
- Initializes subsystem stack for spectral signature suppression

---

### üß© Core Subsystems

#### 1. Magnetic Torus Field Control
- Modulates magnetic confinement field from molten lead loop
- Shifts shape and density to:
  - Refract outbound EM
  - Scatter radar and RF scans
  - Shield emission surfaces

#### 2. EM Phase Cancellation Module
- Samples reactor's EM profile
- Generates waveforms for destructive interference
- Cancels signals in:
  - Radio
  - Radar
  - Infrared
  - Thermal

#### 3. TPV Emission Masking
- Alters thermophotovoltaic spectrum output
- Matches CMB or planetary background noise
- Reduces IR visibility during heat surges

#### 4. Optional Lead Plasma Bloom (Emergency Cloak)
- Vents superheated plasma from backup loop
- Creates a radiative fog for temporary cover
- Scrambles thermal, radar, and visual systems

### ‚ö° Signature Suppression Flow

**Torus + Phase Cancellation**
  -> Multi-Spectrum Signature Suppression  
  -> Obscures all EM output except gravitational presence

**TPV Masking + Plasma Bloom**
  -> Ghost Cloak  
  -> Blocks IR, radar, optical, thermal, and passive detection

---

### ü§ñ AI Feedback Loop

- GhostCore AI monitors active scan attempts
- Adjusts power allocation and subsystem priority:
  - If radar pinged ‚Üí Boost Phase Cancellation
  - If thermal lock detected ‚Üí TPV masking override
  - If lock-on occurs ‚Üí Plasma bloom engaged

---

### ‚ò¢Ô∏è Fallback Behavior

- If SCRAM or overheating occurs:
  - Torus field collapses safely
  - TPV output drops to maintenance level
  - Plasma vent deactivates
  - Signature breach logged to:
    `GhostEnergyLab/Incursions/WraithSkin_<timestamp>.log`
