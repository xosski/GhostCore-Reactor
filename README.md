# 🚀 GhostCore Reactor Suite

A future-forward, physics-backed research project fusing thermophotovoltaics (TPV), molten lead systems, photon propulsion, and weaponized electromagnetic shielding.

This suite is **reverse engineered from classified silence** and released for public research, red team simulation, and high-efficiency off-world infrastructure development.
