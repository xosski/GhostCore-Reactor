# 🔥 GhostCore Reactor Suite

Welcome to the **GhostCore Reactor Suite** — an open-source platform for simulating and visualizing advanced energy systems based on thermophotovoltaic (TPV) reactors, molten lead cooling loops, and propulsion-defense hybrid technologies.

Reverse engineered from **classified silence**, designed for red team thought experiments, extraterrestrial propulsion systems, and energy autonomy research.
