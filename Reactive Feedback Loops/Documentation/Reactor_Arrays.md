### Abstract

This whitepaper outlines the proof of concept for a speculative energy synchronization system designed around a central oscillatory power source—hereafter referred to as the *Reactor Hum*—and a network of reactive subsystems, modeled as *Node Oscillators*. The intention is to establish a harmonic feedback loop wherein each subsystem aligns its operational frequency with the reactor core, thereby improving energy efficiency through synchronized phase-locking. The project introduces theoretical considerations of time-crystalline influence and proposes a simulated platform for evaluating feasibility.

### Introduction

The GhostCore Harmonic Feedback System is built on the wildly ambitious notion that synchronized energetic resonance—akin to biological homeostasis but dumber and louder—can be leveraged in a scalable energy architecture. This theoretical system assumes the existence of an oscillating ground-state entity ("time crystal"), a plasma battery matrix, and high-reactivity loop energy storage mechanisms that, under harmonic conditions, result in energy efficiency improvements across subsystems.

### Objectives

1. Simulate a ReactorCore emitting a sinusoidal frequency.
2. Establish Node Oscillators that dynamically adjust to the core's hum.
3. Evaluate phase-locking behavior over time.
4. Quantify energy efficiency based on synchronization.

### Methodology

* **Environment**: Python-based simulation using `NumPy` and `Matplotlib`.
* **Reactor Pulse**: Sinusoidal wave generator operating at 440 Hz.
* **Nodes**: Independent oscillators initialized at varying frequencies. Nodes adjust their frequency gradually toward the reactor's frequency with a damping factor of 0.01.
* **Efficiency Metrics**: Calculated based on the phase difference between the node and the reactor waveform.

  * In-phase (Δ < 0.2): +10% Efficiency
  * Slightly out of phase (0.2 < Δ < 0.5): -5% Efficiency
  * Divergent (Δ > 0.5): -20% Efficiency

Simulation steps were executed 100 times with dynamic recalibration of node frequencies after each interval.

### Results

Initial testing indicates the oscillators rapidly converge toward the reactor's frequency over the first 20 iterations. Subsequent cycles produce a relatively stable harmonic state, wherein efficiency stabilizes near optimal values. Full waveform visualizations are pending but data logs suggest positive reinforcement behavior within the feedback system.

### Applications & Speculation

* Reactive cloaking systems that require frequency alignment.
* Plasma-based energy retention systems.
* Drone swarm synchrony for tactical formations.
* General-purpose techno-mysticism in propulsion engineering.

Future iterations may incorporate:

* Quasi-periodic oscillators simulating time crystals.
* Environmental stochastic interference.
* Feedback overload conditions to simulate system resonance collapse (because why not?).

### Conclusion

While hilariously theoretical, the GhostCore Harmonic Feedback System demonstrates a viable conceptual model for subsystem coordination through frequency synchronization. The simulated phase-locking efficiency model provides a foundation for further exploration into quantum-ish energy harmonics, time-crystal mythology, and glorious pseudo-scientific madness.

This is only the beginning, which should worry everyone.
