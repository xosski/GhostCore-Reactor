## ‚öîÔ∏è Tactical Use Breakdown ‚Äì Directed Energy Beams

### 1. Photon Lasers
**Modes:** IR Burn, UV Disruptor, Visible Pulse  
**Tactical Use Cases:**
- Anti-hull precision strike (IR)
- Drone blinding or destruction (UV)
- Area denial & psychological operations (Visible)

### 2. Microwave Lances
**Tactical Use Cases:**
- Disable enemy electronics without explosive force
- Target drone clusters mid-flight
- Non-destructive data wipe or disruption of comms systems

### 3. Pulsed EMP Needles
**Tactical Use Cases:**
- Disable enemy navigation systems without power grid overkill
- Pinpoint attack on vulnerable modules
- Precision neutralization of radar or control nodes

### 4. Spectral Adaptive Beam (Experimental)
**Tactical Use Cases:**
- Counter-adaptive armor and shifting energy shields
- Bypass conventional defense frequency tuning
- Scramble or blind multispectrum surveillance systems
