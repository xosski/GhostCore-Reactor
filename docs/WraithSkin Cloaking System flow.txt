🧬 WraithSkin Cloaking System – Flow Breakdown (Text Format)
🔰 System Activation
GhostCore AI issues activation command

WraithSkin subroutines are initialized via GhostResidency cloak manager

🧩 Core Subsystems Initialized
Each module operates independently but shares timing via the AI scheduler:

1. Magnetic Torus Field Control
Engages the molten lead loop’s magnetic confinement field

Shifts the shape and intensity of EM field to:

Scatter radar pulses

Refract outbound emissions

Redirect passive scans

2. EM Phase Cancellation Module
Analyzes all outbound electromagnetic radiation (EMR)

Generates destructive interference waveforms

Cancels outbound signal across:

Radio

Radar

Thermal

Low-frequency infrared

3. TPV Emission Masking
Adjusts the thermophotovoltaic output of the reactor core

Mimics background EM levels:

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)

Solar reflections

Atmospheric ghosting (if near planets)

4. Optional Lead Plasma Bloom (Emergency Cloak)
Momentarily vents superheated ionized lead plasma

Creates a radiation fog to:

Blind IR/Radar tracking systems

Confuse heat-seeking weapon guidance

⚡ Signature Suppression Output
From Magnetic Torus + EM Phase Cancellation:

→ “Multi-Spectrum Signature Suppression”
→ Lowers detectability across all radar and radio-based tracking systems.

From TPV Masking + Lead Plasma (if triggered):

→ “Ghost Cloak”
→ Nullifies thermal and light-based tracking, including IRST and visible-light telescopy.

🤖 AI Response & Feedback Loop
Reactor AI monitors external scans using GhostLogger + AnomalyHunter

Dynamically adjusts which subsystem is emphasized:

Radar ping? Boost Phase Cancellation

Heat lock? Pulse TPV masking

Lock-on detected? Activate Plasma Bloom (if authorized)

☢️ Fallback & Deactivation
On SCRAM or system overload:

WraithSkin disables safely

Ship reroutes heat through backup radiators
